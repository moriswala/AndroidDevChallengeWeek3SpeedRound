## :scroll: Description
Implemented mock UI as per the requirement given in the design document from Google.
App is supporting both dark and light theme purely android jetpack-compose.
Dark/Light mode can be configured from AppThemeState.kt using boolean property darkTheme.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
It was intended to learn newly released android jetpack-compose. I really enjoyed developing with it. I hope you will also enjoy development using android jetpack-compose.
